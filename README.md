# Sales-Data-Analysis
Data analyst project based on Sales Dataset using Excel, Python and Power BI

This project examines Acme Co.'s regional sales data from 2014 to 2018 to uncover the drivers of revenue, profit, and market performance. The analysis is directed toward assessing the contributions of product, channel, and region; the identification of seasonal patterns; detection of pricing and margin outliers; and actual results versus the planned budget.
Through the use of Excel, Python, and Power BI, this project transforms raw sales data into actionable business insights. These findings inform strategic decisions toward price optimization, promotional planning, and aligning inventory and market expansion to reduce concentration risk and ensure sustainable growth.
